<p style="text-align: justify;">DAC cable, or “Direct Attach Copper Cable”, is a type of 

copper cable which is similar to coaxial cable and also a form of high speed cable with SFP 

connectors on each end. As for the market nowadays, there are mainly three kinds of DAC 

according to the transmission rate: 10G SFP+ DAC, 40G QSFP+ DAC and 100G QSFP28 DAC in order 

to meet the increasing demand for cost-efficient delivery of more bandwidth. Today we will 

introduce the SFP+ DAC cable with the focus on types and advantages of SFP+ DAC cable.</p>

<h2>The Types of SFP+ Direct Attach Copper Cable</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SFP+ direct attach copper cable, also known as twinax cable, 

is an SFP+ cable assembly used in rack connections between servers and switches. It consists 

of a high speed copper cable and two SFP+ copper modules. It is widely used for short-distance 

and high speed Internet, such as gigabit network card, Gigabit switch, million server and etc. 

In general, SFP+ direct attach copper cable has two types, SFP+ active direct attach copper 

cable and SFP+ passive direct attach copper cable.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">An Active DAC contains electronics for signal 

conditioning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Passive DAC does not contain electronics for signal 

conditioning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It means that, if a switch provides signal conditioning 

integrated into a port, then a Passive DAC is used. A Passive DAC costs less than an Active 

DAC, but the upfront cost of the switch is more expensive. Similarly, if a switch does not 

provide signal conditioning integrated into a port, then an Active DAC is used. An Active DAC 

costs more than a Passive DAC, but the upfront cost of the switch is less.</p>

<h2>The Advantages of SFP+ Direct Attach Copper Cable</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SFP+ DAC cable sets the ball rolling in data centers mainly 

because of below factors.</p>
<div><strong>More Stable</strong></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a design optimized for structure and reduces the use of 

electronic components, then further avoids the repair rate caused by the electronic component. 

So it will be more stable and durable.</p>
<div><strong>Short Distance</strong></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since DAC cable does not need patch panels or additional 

cables when connected to devices, as is the case with an?optical module. The module on both 

ends with scientific layout makes them sturdy and reliable as well as space-saving.</p>
<div><strong>Low Power Consumption</strong></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As is know to all that denser equipment in the data center or 

server rooms will result in the consuming of more electrical power and production of more 

heat. Then more cooling systems are required. However, DAC cable can realize ultra-low power 

consumption and heat dissipation, which achieves the destination of energy saving and 

environmental protection.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SPF+ DAC cable provides a low power consumption and high-speed 

solution for data center interconnections. With the ability to support data rate of 10G, 40G 

and 100G, they are now widely used in optical links. If you would like to know more about SPF+ 

DAC cable, Fiberstore are available with custom version and brand compatible versions. All of 

them are 100% compatible with major brands like Cisco, HP, Juniper, Enterasys, Extreme, H3C 

and so on. Both passive twinax cables in lengths of 1, 3 and 5 meters, and active twinax 

cables in lengths of 7 and 10 meters are on the supply. You can get high quality SFP+ cables 

and worldwide delivery from Fiberstore.</p>
